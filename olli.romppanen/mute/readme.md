My final project for the course is a MUTE for trombone/baritone horn.

STEPS of the project are

1)creating a 3d model of the bell of my two instruments in Rhino

2)creating a mute inside the model of the bell (for steps 1&2 see mute2.stl, *.3dm and *.blend files)

3)trying to manufacture the mute file with Ultimaker
*realizing that the printer quality is not sufficient and the printer(+the software) can't currently handle objects that are deserved size of the mute

4)scaling the mute down to be used as a part of new mute design made of styrofoam (for 3d prints of mute see *.STL files)

5)printing two different "mini-mutes" with different structure for use with the "big mute"
(filtteri1.jpg, filtteri2.jpg)

6)modeling the mute with rhino (styrofoam ring with a hole for "mini-mutes", see mute3.stl)

7)milling the styrofoam ring

8)combining styrofoam ring and mutes made of PLA

9)testing the sound

10)testing the fit and sound. sound and control excellent with the mute with free airflow ventile. Restricted airflow ventile good for glissandos.

11)first styrofoam ring shaped by cutting and sanding for better fit

12)second styrofoam ring milled with CNC and sanded, glued together for the final prototype


FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

Someone with a decent printer can already print out the mute optimized for Bach42 tenor trombone or baritone horn in B.
Silicone strips to protect the brass need to be added, though.
If the mute is printed as "a thin walled cup", the mute could host a microcontroller with additional features like sound/light effect

Ring-type styrofoam mute needs to be modified for better hold in the bell of the brass.
Also the optimal air flow needs to be studied for minimal change to the tonality/feel of playing.
