My final project for the course is a MUTE for trombone/baritone horn.

STEPS of the project are

1)creating a 3d model of the bell of my two instruments in Rhino

2)creating a mute inside the model of the bell

3)trying to manufacture the mute file with Ultimaker
*realizing that the printer quality is not sufficient and the printer(+the software) can't currently handle objects that are deserved size of the mute

4)scaling the mute down to be used as a part of new mute design made of styrofoam

5)printing two different "mini-mutes" with different structure for use with the "big mute"

6)modeling the mute with rhino (styrofoam ring with a hole for "mini-mutes"

7)milling the styrofoam ring

8)combining styrofoam ring and mutes made of PLA

9)testing the sound
