A lasercut box with dimensions 10cm x 10cm x 5cm
It was designed to be used as a container for newly planted herbs or small fruit trees, hence the holes at the bottom for drainage and the holes on the top for the plant to grow out of and for it to be watered.

The vector design can be found in the .ai file.
