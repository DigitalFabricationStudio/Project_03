The 3D scan was retrieved using 40 photos within the 123D Catch iPhone application. It took two attempts due to motion, bad framing and inconsistent lighting in the first one.

The 3D model was slightly fixed in Netfabb and Maya and finally optimised in Blender before being sent to the milling and printing.

The projects developed during the Digital Fabrication Studio course, 0.2 edition
