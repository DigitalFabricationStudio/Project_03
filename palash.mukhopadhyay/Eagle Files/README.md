Eagle Files
============

This folder contains a few files for Eagle that proved helpful through the course.

1. Arduino board schematics (arduino_Uno_Rev3-02-TH.brd & arduino_Uno_Rev3-02-TH.sch)
2. Instructions on how to add custom parts to Eagle (How-to-make-a-custom-library-part-in-Eagle-CAD-too.pdf). Originally from <http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-custom-library-part-in-Eagle-CAD-too/?ALLSTEPS>.
3. Custom parts OPT580 and OPT 280 wrapped in an aalto-fablab library (aalto-fablab.lbr).
4. A collection of useful libraries (lbr.zip).
