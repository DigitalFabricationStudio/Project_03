Lasercut Box
============

Making a laser cut box is probably one of the simplest thing in the FabLab.

Go here: <http://boxmaker.rahulbotics.com/>

Input the numbers and download the generated PDF.

Then just import into the controlling software for the laser cutter and print!

**Keep in mind the KERF (cut width in the box generator above)! It is material
dependent, and for this exercise, was about 0.2mm for 3mm MDF.**

Source files are here, including an unfinished Rhino attempt. Pictures follow.

Here are some pictures of the second box I did, with a cutaway on one side, and some Elvish engraved text along the side. Source files in the folder, and some pictures here.
