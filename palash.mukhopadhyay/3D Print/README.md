3D Printing
============

Take the file after 3D Cleaning process into the [Cura software](http://wiki.ultimaker.com/Cura) to prepare it for 3D printing on the [Ultimaker](http://ultimaker.com/). The Ultimaker uses PLA or ABS to print in 3D, and for this exercise PLA was used.

In Cura, scale or rotate the model as needed (I used a scale of 1.5), and prepare the print-process at the quality desired (I used High Quality print). Obviously, higher quality prints and larger prints need more time. This generates a gcode file (barbara_00_cut_rotated.gcode), which can then be transferred to the Ultimaker on an SD Card for printing.

On the Ultimaker, prepare the print by heating the print-head, and then selecting the model file from the card menu. Use 20% speed for the first layers to allow the melted PLA to cool, solidify properly and build up a stable base. After the base layers are done, the process can be sped up to 80-100%.

My model (35x25x15mm.) took approx. 1.5hrs. to print while the Cura software estimated 45mins. (at 100% speed).
