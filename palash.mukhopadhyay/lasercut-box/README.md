Lasercut Box
============

Making a laser cut box is probably one of the simplest thing in the FabLab.

Go here: <http://boxmaker.rahulbotics.com/>

Input the numbers and download the generated PDF.

Then just import into the controlling software for the laser cutter and print!

**Keep in mind the KERF (cut width in the box generator above)! It is material
dependent, and for this exercise, was about 0.2mm for 3mm MDF.**
