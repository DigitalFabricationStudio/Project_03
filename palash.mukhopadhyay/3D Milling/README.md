3D Milling
============

Since the outcome of this milling process was to be used for making a silicone mold, the model needed to be walled and placed on a base. I used [Rhino](http://mac.rhino3d.com/) for this - imported the STL file and built the walls and base for it while maintaining the required scale (barbara-milling.3dm).

The exported STL (barbara-milling.stl, barbara-milling-small.stl) were then used to mill using the Roland Modela player.

**Keep in mind that milling is a very slow process, and a very delicate one. So, keep models as small as possible and try not to interrupt the process.**

**Also, select a partial area for finishing since only the detailed parts of the model need finishing, not the box strudture outside.**
