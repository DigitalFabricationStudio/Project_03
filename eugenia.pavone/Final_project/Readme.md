**Avant-propos -** 

I've designed a tic-tac-toe game made of plywood and created a suitable "pocket" package from 0.1mm plywood using cnc milling and laser cut machine. The package is small and ergonomic, so it's easy to carry it around and play in any occasion.  

**Machines & settings -** 

1. Milling
   * test_1: wood (7.5*7.5*3cm), printing time: 1h55"
   * test_2: plywood (7.5*7.5*0.9cm), printing time: 1h05"

2. Laser cut
   * test_1: plywood 1.2mm, 100/40. 100/70/500
   * test_2: plywood 0.8mm, 100/50. 100/65/500
   * test_3 (final prototype): plywood 0.1mm, 100/25. 100/50/500

**Softwares -** 

   * Rhino 3D
   * Illustrator

**Designing & sketching -** 

First, I made a 3D model of the playing board on rhino and measured the pieces thanks to the dimensions of the board. Making the board was the easy part of project. After that, I designed the package for the game in Illustrator by making several templates. 

**Testing & prototyping -** 

1. Milling - the board
   * test_1: **problems -** too close to 0, not centered, material too thick
   * test_2: **solutions -** thin material faster roughing, **problems -** board still not centered.

2. Laser cut - the package
   * test_1: **problems -** plywood 1.2mm too thick, hard to fold, breaking easily. 
   * test_2: **solutions -** thiner material, easier to fold, **problems -** still fragile when folding, disproportionate packaging. 
   * test_3 (final prototype): **solutions -** made package adjustments, perfect folding, **problems -** strong engraving, very thin. 

***NB_Wood is a very fragile material for packaging. It has an elegant look but one has to find find the appropriate thickness. Otherwise, the wooden piece will be hard to fold and will break easily due to the press ion while folding.***

Below, some shots made of the final prototype in 0.1mm plywood.
