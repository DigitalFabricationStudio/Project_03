#3D printed_Head#

To obtain a 3D scan, I used **123D catch** software for iPhone. (it can be found here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/123d-catch/id513913018?mt=8). Ideally, one should take approximately 30 to 40 pictures of the face or object to 3D print, in 3 different angles (front, up and down angles). 

Once the file is generated with 123D catch, you have to open it with Blender and start the *"cleaning"*/ *"repairing"* mesh. My model wasn't perfect, especially for the face that was distorted. I had to use the *"polishing"* tool to get a better and clean result. Before cleaning everything up, remember to **remesh** the model with a sharpness of *8* and then export the .STL to Netfab, to cut it and repair it once again. 

Next step, prepare the file on Cura to print it with the **Ultimaker machine**. The model has been cut from the back and placed it in an horizontal position for a better and fast rendering in 3D. Tips: decrease the speed to 20% for the first layers and then increase it after until reaching 90-100%. 

**Print_time: 53 minutes.**
