#Milling_Head#

First, prepare the file for printing either on Rhino or Blender. I used Rhino for making the box. Export your 3D_head in .STL from Blender and import it in Rhino. Create a bounding box for the  milling (80*80*50mm for the outer box and 75*75*20mm for the inner part). Place the design in the middle of the box and export it, once again, in .STL file. ***Remember, leave enough space around the model for the milling.***  

Next, cut the styrofoam with the right dimensions (100*100*50mmm), put double sided tape and place it on the machine. After, open your file in Modela Player and set up the settings for *"roughing"* and *"finishing"*. Then, you just have to wait that the job is complete.  

**Print_time: approx. 2 hours.** 

*__Tip: you can remesh your geometry in Blender and use the sharpness at 7 instead of 8. It will decrease the number of isocurves and you will get a faster rendering on Modela Player.__*
