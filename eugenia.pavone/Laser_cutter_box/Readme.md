Laser cut settings: 

* MDF 3mm

1. Box 1
   * raster (100, 40)
   * vector (20, 60, 500) 

2. Box 2
   * raster (95, 55)
   * vector (20, 60, 500)

The original template has been created with __Box.Maker__ http://boxmaker.rahulbotics.com/
Dimensions: 100*100*50(mm). Then, the template was imported in Rhino to deal with the cutting width, set up at 0.5mm. Several attempts (cut width: 2mm, 1mm, 0.7mm) were made with the laser. 

Once the file was ready to print, I imported the template to Illustrator to insert some graphics in order to engrave them. In the end, I printed out 4 boxes with several designs but with the same proportions so I can stack them together in the end.  

*__Tip: to get rid of the black marks due to the laser burning, you can use sanding paper to clean everything.__*
