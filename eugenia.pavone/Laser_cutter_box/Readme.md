The original template has been created with __Box.Maker__ http://boxmaker.rahulbotics.com/
* dimensions: 100*100*50(mm). Then, the template was imported in Rhino to deal with the cutting width, set up at 0.5mm. Several attempts (cut width: 2mm, 1mm, 0.7mm) were made with the laser.  

*__Tip: to get rid of the black marks due to the laser burning, you can use sanding paper to clean everything.__*
