\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 1. Mdf laser cut box
\b0 \
\
Online application - BoxMaker. Choose the size of the box, set parameters, press "design it!" -- download the file -- open in illustrator. Compose the details so they will use the space of mdf shit with minimum leftovers and combine the lines (it's faster to cut once, than cut 2 separate lines). It's better to close the contours (faster cutting in an organized way). I stubbled with cut width parameters. So for 3 mm mdf shit the best cut width is 0.008 cm.\

\b 2. 3D scanning
\b0 \
\
I installed 123D Catch application for iPhone. Then created 40 photos to build a 3D model. Then I sent this model to myself via e-mail. Then the model should be opened it in Blender in order to close the shape with remash modifier tool. Then it should be cut in Netfabb (repair part - cut - remove (right button) -- in the end press repair. Save in .stl format for 3D printer. \
\
3. 3D printing\
\
Open 3D file in Cura. The model is quite small, so I scaled it 1.5. Place it flat for more comfortable printing process. \
