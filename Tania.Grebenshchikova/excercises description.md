## 1. Mdf laser cut box

Online application - BoxMaker. Choose the size of the box, set parameters, press "design it!" -- download the file -- open in illustrator. Compose the details so they will use the space of mdf shit with minimum leftovers and combine the lines (it's faster to cut once, than cut 2 separate lines). It's better to close the contours (faster cutting in an organized way). I stubbled with cut width parameters. So for 3 mm mdf shit the best cut width is 0.008 cm.

## 2. 3D scanning

I installed 123D Catch application for iPhone. Then created 40 photos to build a 3D model. Then I sent this model to myself via e-mail. Then the model should be opened it in Blender in order to close the shape with remash modifier tool. Then it should be cut in Netfabb (repair part - cut - remove (right button) -- in the end press repair. Save in .stl format for 3D printer. 

## 3. 3D printing

Open 3D file in Cura. The model is quite small, so I scaled it 1.5. Place it flat for more comfortable printing process. Don't forget to turn on a printer ( I was wondering why is the heating process so slow?). I increased the speed from 20% to 85%. I copied my .stl file to memory card and inserted it directly into the printer, so I didn't need a computer for that. 

## 4. Milling

Always set ZERO! Write down the coordinates. (X:10, Y:15). Set up the material - we used styrenefoam. Set up the milling bit - 3 mm square. Partial (scale). - amount of space around and move the milling bit. 
For milling I used the same model as for 3D printing. But I created in Rhino 2 cubes using boolean tool. Boolean (1) - enter - Boolean (2) - enter. 
For rough milling - all the shape, and for refining milling - only a face. 

To cancel print: press view (machine) - system settings (computer) - printing - model (right click) - print queue - delete (cancel jobs). Then press up and down buttons together on the machine to delete work both from machine and computer. 

## 5. Moulding and casting

Add some spray to the styrene foam shape. 
Mix component A ( clear silicon) and component B (polysiloxanes). 
Start to mould from lower parts. Then shake the form in order to prevent bubbles. 
After about 16 hours the silicon will get hard.

I used the same 3D model for 3D printing, milling and casting. The most detailed result was achieved with 3D printer. The milled shape was not that clear, the features of a face were hardly recognizable. Then after moulding and casting, when I had an ice shape, it became even more difficult to recognize the face.
